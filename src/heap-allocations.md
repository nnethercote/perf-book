# Heap Allocations

Heap allocations are moderately expensive. The exact details depend on which
allocator is in use, but each allocation (and deallocation) typically involves
acquiring a global lock, doing some non-trivial data structure manipulation,
and possibly executing a system call. Small allocations are not necessarily
cheaper than large allocations. It is worth understanding which Rust data
structures and operations cause allocations, because avoiding them can greatly
improve performance.

The [Rust Container Cheat Sheet] has visualizations of common Rust types, and
is an excellent companion to the following sections.

## Profiling

If a general-purpose profiler shows `malloc`, `free`, and related functions as
hot, then it is likely worth trying to reduce the allocation rate and/or using
an alternative allocator.

[DHAT] is an excellent profiler to use when reducing allocation rates. It works
on Linux and some other Unixes. It precisely identifies hot allocation
sites and their allocation rates. Exact results will vary, but experience with
rustc has shown that reducing allocation rates by 10 allocations per million
instructions executed can have measurable performance improvements (e.g. ~1%).

[DHAT]: https://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/dh-manual.html

Here is some example output from DHAT.

  }
}
```
It is beyond the scope of this book to describe everything in this example, but
it should be clear that DHAT gives a wealth of information about allocations,
such as where and how often they happen, how big they are, how long they live
for, and how often they are accessed.

## `Box`

[`Box`] is the simplest heap-allocated type. A `Box<T>` value is a `T` value
that is allocated on the heap.

[`Box`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html

It is sometimes worth boxing one or more fields in a struct or enum fields to
make a type smaller. (See the [Type Sizes](type-sizes.md) chapter for more
about this.)

Other than that, `Box` is straightforward and does not offer much scope for
optimizations.

## `Rc`/`Arc`

[`Rc`]/[`Arc`] are similar to `Box`, but the value on the heap is accompanied by
two reference counts. They allow value sharing, which can be an effective way
to reduce memory usage.

[`Rc`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html
[`Arc`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html

However, if used for values that are rarely shared, they can increase allocation
rates by heap allocating values that might otherwise not be heap-allocated.
[**Example**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37373/commits/c440a7ae654fb641e68a9ee53b03bf3f7133c2fe).

Unlike `Box`, calling `clone` on an `Rc`/`Arc` value does not involve an
allocation. Instead, it merely increments a reference count.

## `Vec`

[`Vec`] is a heap-allocated type with a great deal of scope for optimizing the
number of allocations, and/or minimizing the amount of wasted space. To do this
requires understanding how its elements are stored.

[`Vec`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html

A `Vec` contains three words: a length, a capacity, and a pointer. The pointer
will point to heap-allocated memory if the capacity is nonzero and the element
size is nonzero; otherwise, it will not point to allocated memory.

Even if the `Vec` itself is not heap-allocated, the elements (if present and
nonzero-sized) always will be. If nonzero-sized elements are present, the
memory holding those elements may be larger than necessary, providing space for
additional future elements. The number of elements present is the length, and
the number of elements that could be held without reallocating is the capacity.

When the vector needs to grow beyond its current capacity, the elements will be
copied into a larger heap allocation, and the old heap allocation will be
freed.

### `Vec` growth

A new, empty `Vec` created by the common means
([`vec![]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.vec.html)
or [`Vec::new`] or [`Vec::default`]) has a length and capacity of zero, and no
heap allocation is required. If you repeatedly push individual elements onto
the end of the `Vec`, it will periodically reallocate. The growth strategy is
not specified, but at the time of writing it uses a quasi-doubling strategy
resulting in the following capacities: 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. (It
skips directly from 0 to 4, instead of going via 1 and 2, because this [avoids
many allocations] in practice.) As a vector grows, the frequency of
reallocations will decrease exponentially, but the amount of possibly-wasted
excess capacity will increase exponentially.

[`Vec::new`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.new
[`Vec::default`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html#tymethod.default
[avoids many allocations]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72227

This growth strategy is typical for growable data structures and reasonable in
the general case, but if you know in advance the likely length of a vector you
can often do better. If you have a hot vector allocation site (e.g. a hot
[`Vec::push`] call), it is worth using [`eprintln!`] to print the vector length
at that site and then doing some post-processing (e.g. with [`counts`]) to
determine the length distribution. For example, you might have many short
vectors, or you might have a smaller number of very long vectors, and the best
way to optimize the allocation site will vary accordingly.

[`Vec::push`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.push
[`eprintln!`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.eprintln.html
[`counts`]: https://github.com/nnethercote/counts/

### Short `Vec`s

If you have many short vectors, you can use the `SmallVec` type from the
[`smallvec`] crate. `SmallVec<[T; N]>` is a drop-in replacement for `Vec` that
can store `N` elements within the `SmallVec` itself, and then switches to a
heap allocation if the number of elements exceeds that. (Note also that
`vec![]` literals must be replaced with `smallvec![]` literals.)
[**Example 1**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50565/commits/78262e700dc6a7b57e376742f344e80115d2d3f2),
[**Example 2**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55383/commits/526dc1421b48e3ee8357d58d997e7a0f4bb26915).

[`smallvec`]: https://crates.io/crates/smallvec

`SmallVec` reliably reduces the allocation rate when used appropriately, but
its use does not guarantee improved performance. It is slightly slower than
`Vec` for normal operations because it must always check if the elements are
heap-allocated or not. Also, If `N` is high or `T` is large, then the
`SmallVec<[T; N]>` itself can be larger than `Vec<T>`, and copying of
`SmallVec` values will be slower. As always, benchmarking is required to
confirm that an optimization is effective.

If you have many short vectors *and* you precisely know their maximum length,
`ArrayVec` from the [`arrayvec`] crate is a better choice than `SmallVec`. It
does not require the fallback to heap allocation, which makes it a little
faster.
[**Example**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74310/commits/c492ca40a288d8a85353ba112c4d38fe87ef453e).

[`arrayvec`]: https://crates.io/crates/arrayvec

### Longer `Vec`s

If you know the minimum or exact size of a vector, you can reserve a specific
capacity with [`Vec::with_capacity`], [`Vec::reserve`], or
[`Vec::reserve_exact`]. For example, if you know a vector will grow to have at
least 20 elements, these functions can immediately provide a vector with a
capacity of at least 20 using a single allocation, whereas pushing the items
one at a time would result in four allocations (for capacities of 4, 8, 16, and
32).
[**Example**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77990/commits/a7f2bb634308a5f05f2af716482b67ba43701681).

[`Vec::with_capacity`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.with_capacity
[`Vec::reserve`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve
[`Vec::reserve_exact`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve_exact

If you know the maximum length of a vector, the above functions also let you
not allocate excess space unnecessarily. Similarly, [`Vec::shrink_to_fit`] can be
used to minimize wasted space, but note that it may cause a reallocation.

[`Vec::shrink_to_fit`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.shrink_to_fit

## `String`

A [`String`] contains heap-allocated bytes. The representation and operation of
`String` are very similar to that of `Vec<u8>`. Many `Vec` methods relating to
growth and capacity have equivalents for `String`, such as
[`String::with_capacity`].

[`String`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html
[`String::with_capacity`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.with_capacity

The `SmallString` type from the [`smallstr`] crate is similar to the `SmallVec`
type.

[`smallstr`]: https://crates.io/crates/smallstr

The `String` type from the [`smartstring`] crate is a drop-in replacement for
`String` that avoids heap allocations for strings with less than three words'
worth of characters. On 64-bit platforms, this is any string that is less than
24 bytes, which includes all strings containing 23 or fewer ASCII characters.
[**Example**](https://github.com/djc/topfew-rs/commit/803fd566e9b889b7ba452a2a294a3e4df76e6c4c).

[`smartstring`]: https://crates.io/crates/smartstring

Note that the `format!` macro produces a `String`, which means it performs an
allocation. If you can avoid a `format!` call by using a string literal, that
will avoid this allocation.
[**Example**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55905/commits/c6862992d947331cd6556f765f6efbde0a709cf9).
[`std::format_args`] and/or the [`lazy_format`] crate may help with this.

[`std::format_args`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format_args.html
[`lazy_format`]: https://crates.io/crates/lazy_format

## Hash tables

[`HashSet`] and [`HashMap`] are hash tables. Their representation and
operations are similar to those of `Vec`, in terms of allocations: they have
a single contiguous heap allocation, holding keys and values, which is
reallocated as necessary as the table grows. Many `Vec` methods relating to
growth and capacity have equivalents for `HashSet`/`HashMap`, such as
[`HashSet::with_capacity`].

[`HashSet`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html
[`HashMap`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html
[`HashSet::with_capacity`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html#method.with_capacity

## `Cow`

Sometimes you have some borrowed data, such as a `&str`, that is mostly
read-only but occasionally needs to be modified. Cloning the data every time
would be wasteful. Instead you can use "clone-on-write" semantics via the
[`Cow`] type, which can represent both borrowed and owned data.

[`Cow`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/enum.Cow.html

Typically, when starting with a borrowed value `x` you wrap it in a `Cow` with
`Cow::Borrowed(x)`. Because `Cow` implements [`Deref`], you can call
non-mutating methods directly on the data it encloses. If mutation is desired,
[`Cow::to_mut`] will obtain a mutable reference to an owned value, cloning if
necessary.

[`Deref`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html
[`Cow::to_mut`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/enum.Cow.html#method.to_mut

`Cow` can be fiddly to get working, but it is often worth the effort.
[**Example 1**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37064/commits/b043e11de2eb2c60f7bfec5e15960f537b229e20),
[**Example 2**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50855/commits/ad471452ba6fbbf91ad566dc4bdf1033a7281811),
[**Example 3**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56336/commits/787959c20d062d396b97a5566e0a766d963af022),
[**Example 4**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/68848/commits/67da45f5084f98eeb20cc6022d68788510dc832a).

## `clone`

Calling [`clone`] on a value that contains heap-allocated memory typically
involves additional allocations. For example, calling `clone` on a non-empty
`Vec` requires a new allocation for the elements (but note that the capacity of
the new `Vec` might not be the same as the capacity of the original `Vec`). The
exception is `Rc`/`Arc`, where a `clone` call just increments the reference
count.

[`clone`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html#tymethod.clone

[`clone_from`] is an alternative to `clone`. `a.clone_from(&b)` is equivalent
to `a = b.clone()` but may avoid unnecessary allocations. For example, if you
want to clone one `Vec` over the top of an existing `Vec`, the existing `Vec`'s
heap allocation will be reused if possible, as the following example shows.
```rust
let mut v1: Vec<u32> = Vec::with_capacity(99);
let v2: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
v1.clone_from(&v2); // v1's allocation is reused
assert_eq!(v1.capacity(), 99);
```
Although `clone` usually causes allocations, it is a reasonable thing to use in
many circumstances and can often make code simpler. Use profiling data to see
which `clone` calls are hot and worth taking the effort to avoid.

[`clone_from`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html#method.clone_from

Sometimes Rust code ends up containing unnecessary `clone` calls, due to (a)
programmer error, or (b) changes in the code that render previously-necessary
`clone` calls unnecessary. If you see a hot `clone` call that does not seem
necessary, sometimes it can simply be removed.
[**Example 1**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37318/commits/e382267cfb9133ef12d59b66a2935ee45b546a61),
[**Example 2**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37705/commits/11c1126688bab32f76dbe1a973906c7586da143f),
[**Example 3**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64302/commits/36b37e22de92b584b9cf4464ed1d4ad317b798be).

## `to_owned`

[`ToOwned::to_owned`] is implemented for many common types. It creates owned
data from borrowed data, usually by cloning, and therefore often causes heap
allocations. For example, it can be used to create a `String` from a `&str`.

[`ToOwned::to_owned`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.ToOwned.html#tymethod.to_owned

Sometimes `to_owned` calls can be avoided by storing a reference to borrowed
data in a struct rather than an owned copy. This requires lifetime annotations
on the struct, complicating the code, and should only be done when profiling
and benchmarking shows that it is worthwhile.
[**Example**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50855/commits/6872377357dbbf373cfd2aae352cb74cfcc66f34).

## Reusing Collections

Sometimes you need to build up a collection such as a `Vec` in stages. It is
usually better to do this by modifying a single `Vec` than by building multiple
`Vec`s and then combining them.

For example, if you have a function `do_stuff` that produces a `Vec` that might
be called multiple times:
```rust
fn do_stuff(x: u32, y: u32) -> Vec<u32> {
    vec![x, y]
}
```
It might be better to instead modify a passed-in `Vec`:
```rust
fn do_stuff(x: u32, y: u32, vec: &mut Vec<u32>) {
    vec.push(x);
    vec.push(y);
}
```
Sometimes it is worth keeping around a "workhorse" collection that can be
reused. For example, if a `Vec` is needed for each iteration of a loop, you
could declare the `Vec` outside the loop, use it within the loop body, and then
call [`clear`] at the end of the loop body (to empty the `Vec` without affecting
its capacity). This avoids allocations at the cost of obscuring the fact that
each iteration's usage of the `Vec` is unrelated to the others.
[**Example 1**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77990/commits/45faeb43aecdc98c9e3f2b24edf2ecc71f39d323),
[**Example 2**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51870/commits/b0c78120e3ecae5f4043781f7a3f79e2277293e7).

[`clear`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.clear

Similarly, it is sometimes worth keeping a "workhorse" collection within a
struct, to be reused in one or more methods that are called repeatedly.

## Using an Alternative Allocator

Another option for improving the performance of allocation-heavy Rust programs
is to replace the default (system) allocator with an alternative allocator. The
exact effect will depend on the individual program and the alternative
allocator chosen, but large improvements in speed and very large reductions in
memory usage have been seen in practice. The effect will also vary across
platforms, because each platform's system allocator has its own strengths and
weaknesses. The use of an alternative allocator can also affect binary size.

One popular alternative allocator for Linux and Mac is [jemalloc], usable via
the [`tikv-jemallocator`] crate. To use it, add a dependency to your
`Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
tikv-jemallocator = "0.4.0"
```
Then add the following somewhere in your Rust code:
```rust,ignore
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc = tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc;
```
[`tikv-jemallocator`] is a fork of the `jemallocator` crate. As of December
2021, `tikv-jemallocator` uses a jemalloc version that is newer and has [better
performance] than the jemalloc version used by `jemallocator`.

Another alternative allocator that works on many platforms is [mimalloc],
usable via the [`mimalloc`] crate.

## Avoiding Regressions

To ensure the number and/or size of allocations done by your code doesn't
increase unintentionally, you can use the *heap usage testing* feature of
[dhat-rs] to write tests that check particular code snippets allocate the
expected amount of heap memory.

[dhat-rs]: https://crates.io/crates/dhat
