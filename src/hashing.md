# Hashing

`HashSet` and `HashMap` are two widely-used types. The default hashing
algorithm is not specified, but at the time of writing the default is an
algorithm called [SipHash 1-3]. This algorithm is high quality—it provides high
protection against collisions—but is relatively slow, particularly for short keys
such as integers.

If profiling shows that hashing is hot, and [HashDoS attacks] are not a concern
for your application, the use of hash tables with faster hash algorithms can
provide large speed wins.
- [`rustc-hash`] provides `FxHashSet` and `FxHashMap` types that are drop-in
  replacements for `HashSet` and `HashMap`. Its hashing algorithm is
  low-quality but very fast, especially for integer keys, and has been found to
  out-perform all other hash algorithms within rustc. ([`fxhash`] is an older,
  less well maintained implementation of the same algorithm and types.)
- [`fnv`] provides `FnvHashSet` and `FnvHashMap` types. Its hashing algorithm
  is higher quality than `rustc-hash`'s but a little slower.
- [`ahash`] provides `AHashSet` and `AHashMap`. Its hashing algorithm can take
  advantage of AES instruction support that is available on some processors.

If hashing performance is important in your program, it is worth trying more
than one of these alternatives. For example, the following results were seen in
rustc.
- The switch from `fnv` to `fxhash` gave [speedups of up to 6%][fnv2fx].
- An attempt to switch from `fxhash` to `ahash` resulted in [slowdowns of
  1-4%][fx2a].
- An attempt to switch from `fxhash` back to the default hasher resulted in
  [slowdowns ranging from 4-84%][fx2default]!

If you decide to universally use one of the alternatives, such as
`FxHashSet`/`FxHashMap`, it is easy to accidentally use `HashSet`/`HashMap` in
some places. You can [use `clippy`] to avoid this problem.

Some types don't need hashing. For example, you might have a newtype that wraps
an integer and the integer values are random, or close to random. For such a
type, the distribution of the hashed values won't be that different to the
distribution of the values themselves. In this case the [`nohash_hasher`] crate
can be useful.

Hash function design is a complex topic and is beyond the scope of this book.
The [`ahash` documentation] has a good discussion.
